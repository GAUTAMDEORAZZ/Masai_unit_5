A transaction is a single logical unit of work that accesses and possibly modifies 
the contents of a database. Transactions access data using read and write operations. 
In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction, 
certain properties are followed. These are called ACID properties.
 
Atomicity:-
By this, we mean that either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesn’t happen at all. There is no midway i.e. 
transactions do not occur partially. Each transaction is considered as one unit and either runs to 
completion or is not executed at all. It involves the following two operations. 
Abort:-If a transaction aborts, changes made to the database are not visible. 
Commit:-If a transaction commits, changes made are visible.
